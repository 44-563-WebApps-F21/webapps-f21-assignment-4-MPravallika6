<p1 class="speech">I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I
didn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.</p1>
<br>

<h6 class="name MISS PRISM"> MISS PRISM.</h6>
<p2 class="speech">Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.</p2>
<br>

<h6 class="name CECILY"> CECILY.</h6>
<p3 class="speech">Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and
couldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible
for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.</p3>
<br>

<h6 class="name MISS PRISM"> MISS PRISM.</h6>
<p4 class="speech">Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one
myself in earlier days.</p4>
<br>

<h6 class="name CECILY"> CECILY.</h6>
<p5 class="speech">Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it
did not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress me so much.</p5>
<br>

<h6 class="name MISS PRISM"> MISS PRISM.</h6>
<p6 class="speech">The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means.</p6>
<br>

<h6 class="name CECILY"> CECILY.</h6>
<p7 class="speech">I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever published?</p7>
<br>

<h6 class="name MISS PRISM"> MISS PRISM.</h6>
<p8 class="speech">Alas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,
these speculations are profitless.</p8>
